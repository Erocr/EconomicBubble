# Economic Bubble

Want to experience what it is like to lead a company that scams people? Economic Bubble is the game for you! This is the game where you can trick your investors, spread fake rumors and create a mega monopoly by disrespecting all morals.

This is a game we made for APOIL's Global Game Jam 2025.

## Features

The features of the game include:
- Advanced economic modeling
- Full control over how you manage your business
- High performance on all systems
- Cross-platform compatibility 

## How to play

The goal of the game is to make as much money as possible without people knowing that you're scamming them. The economic model is designed to make it impossible to succeed without scamming people, so you're forced to put aside your morals.

You lose the game if:
- Public doubt reaches 100%
- Investor doubt reaches 100%
- Your true capital reaches zero
